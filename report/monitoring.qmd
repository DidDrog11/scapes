## Status

Data is being collected from 9 villages across 3 states. This document is to monitor sampling progress and assess the representativeness of our sampling within the villages. We do this by comparing to National and State level statistics. It may also be interesting to compare to data obtained as part of the LASV risk factor review.

villages <- village_state[village_state$abbreviation %in% unique(str_split(hh_df$household_main$household_id, "-", simplify = TRUE)[ , 1]), ]

n_in_households <- max(hh_df$household_demographics$hh_resident_id)

```

`r length(unique(hh_df$household_main$household_id))` households have currently been sampled between the period of `r as.Date(min(hh_df$household_main$start))` and `r as.Date(max(hh_df$household_main$start))`. These households have been sampled in `r length(unique(str_split(hh_df$household_main$household_id, "-", simplify = TRUE)[ , 1]))` village(s). These village(s) are `r paste(paste0(villages$village, " - ", villages$state), collapse = ", ")`.

## Sample characteristics

### Household size

The sampled households include `r n_in_households` individuals with a median of `r median_n_in_households["median_n"]` individuals per household and an interquartile range (IQR) of `r median_n_in_households["iqr_n"]`. This is slightly higher than the mean number of household members reported in the Nigeria DHS 2018 report of 4.3 (urban) and 5 (rural), however, based on the reported summary statistics this is not normally distributed and so the median may be more similar. Further, there may be important heterogeneity by region in Nigeria. Primary data access to the DHS to allow better comparisons has been requested.

#### Distribution of household sizes

``` {r hh-size}

hh_sizes <- hh_df$household_demographics %>%
   group_by(`_index`) %>%
   summarise(n = n()) %>%
   ungroup() 

hh_ids <- hh_df$household_main %>%
   group_by(`_index`) %>%
   summarise(abbreviation = unique(str_split(household_id, "-", simplify = TRUE)[, 1])) %>%
   left_join(village_state, by = "abbreviation")

hh_sizes %>%
   left_join(hh_ids) %>%
   ggplot() +
   geom_bar(aes(x = n, fill = village)) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = village_colours) +
   facet_wrap(~ village, scales = "free_x") +
   theme_minimal() +
   labs(x = "Number of individuals in household",
        y = "Count",
        fill = element_blank())
```

### Sex

`r sex_composition_in_households$n_sex[sex_composition_in_households$sex == "female" & !is.na(sex_composition_in_households$sex)]` females (`r sex_composition_in_households$prop_sex[sex_composition_in_households$sex == "female" & !is.na(sex_composition_in_households$sex)]`) and `r sex_composition_in_households$n_sex[sex_composition_in_households$sex == "male" & !is.na(sex_composition_in_households$sex)]` males (`r sex_composition_in_households$prop_sex[sex_composition_in_households$sex == "male" & !is.na(sex_composition_in_households$sex)]`) are permanently or temporarily resident within these households. This compares to a 1.06 male/female ratio at birth (CIA World Factbook) and data from the DHS 2018 which suggests that women are more likely to reside in rural (54.2%) than urban (45.8%) settings and more so than males (53.6% rural vs. 46.4% urban).

### Age

The sampled households have a median age of `r age_composition_in_households$median_age` (IQR = `r age_composition_in_households$iqr_age`) which compares to a median age of 19.2 (CIA World Factbook). Females within the households sampled have a median age of `r age_composition_sex_stratified$median_age[age_composition_sex_stratified$sex == "female" & !is.na(age_composition_sex_stratified$sex)]` (IQR = `r age_composition_sex_stratified$iqr_age[age_composition_sex_stratified$sex == "female" & !is.na(age_composition_sex_stratified$sex)]`) which compares to 19.4 for females from the CIA World Factbook. Males within sampled households have a median age of `r age_composition_sex_stratified$median_age[age_composition_sex_stratified$sex == "male" & !is.na(age_composition_sex_stratified$sex)]` (IQR = `r age_composition_sex_stratified$iqr_age[age_composition_sex_stratified$sex == "male" & !is.na(age_composition_sex_stratified$sex)]`) which compares to 18.9 for males from the CIA world Factbook.

#### Population pyramid

``` {r population-pyramid}

### Occupation

Occupation as a measure of representativeness will be assessed comparing the individual level surveys with data obtained from the DHS 2018. Comparisons will be made to State level and State stratified by urban/rural. Matching between our survey and DHS classifications for occupation will be limited by the level of detail provided in the DHS. The DHS has been conducted in Females aged 15-49 and Males aged 15-59.
